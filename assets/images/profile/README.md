# assets/images/profile

Place profile-related images here. The site will attempt to use:

- `assets/images/profile/sri_profile_image.HEIC` — original HEIC (the JS will try to convert to JPEG at runtime if the browser can't render HEIC).
- `assets/images/profile/sri_profile_image.jpg` — optional pre-converted JPEG alternative; if you add this it will work in browsers that don't support HEIC conversion.

If you want me to move the existing `context_docs/sri_profile_image.HEIC` into this folder and commit it, say so and I'll add it.
